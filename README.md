# üìù LeetCode Solutions
This repository showcases my progress and solutions for a variety of LeetCode problems, which are a part of my studies in **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

### üí≠ *My Approach*

The main goal of this repository isn't to provide the most optimized or well-written solutions. Instead, it reflects my learning journey, where the focus is on:

* **Understanding the Problem:** Before anything else, I dedicate time to understanding the logic and requirements of each challenge.

* **Developing a Functional Solution:** My priority is to build a correct solution that passes the tests. Time and space optimizations are a bonus, but not the initial focus.

* **Consolidating Concepts:** I use LeetCode as a tool to reinforce my knowledge of many topics.
